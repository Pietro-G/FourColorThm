# FourColorThm
# Background History
This problem was unsolved for about 127 years and then it was finally completed in the 70's with a method that received some controversy. In 1852 Francis Guthrie was coloring in the countries of England on a map and suspected that he could color it with four colors so that neighboring countries were colored differently. Francis Guthrie showed his brother who in turn showed Augustus De Morgan the initial 4 color theorem on 10/23/1852. De Morgan was excited while Hamilton was not, and interest died down in the Four Color Theorem. Till 1878, when Alfred Bray Kempe picked up the four colored theorem. He published his work in 1879 in the second edition of the American Journal of Mathematics. In his approach he used the concept of Kempe Chains, which is a connected chain of points on the graph (See Page 263 in your book). But it turned out there was an error found and the problem went unsolved for a while. Appel and Wolfgang, in the 1970s finally solve the problem by generating a list of networks and showed that every map contains some of these networks and thus the maps were 4 colorable. There were 1936 different configurations in the list initially, which was generated by a computer making this the first computer assisted proof, which at the time was controversial because it involved a huge case analysis, or checking lots of cases, that not many people understood at the time. This computer-assisted proof began making people think about the nature of mathematics and what is considered a proof, the limitations of Humans in Mathematics, and the necessity of Commputers in Mathematics. In their proof they separated 4-colorable graphs or less from 5-colorable graphs and they needed to show that all graphs existed in the 4-colorable or less region, BWOC, All the graphs can be reducible via vertex deletion based on a property found in graphs that one of the list of nearly 2000 networks that would guarantee that a 5-colorable graph was reducible to a 4-colorable graph.

Can you believe how one question about if it was possible to color all maps using only 4 colors became a question of the inclusion of Computers in Math, Who decides what counts as a proof, and the effective use of Graphs as representations of maps(i.e. Knowledge Representation).

Note: after several improvements on the four colored theorem it was reduced to 1482 configurations. 

  Define Problem 
  ---
  The four color theorem states that any seperation of a plane into contigous regions, also known as a "Map" can be colored using at most four colors where the regions in our graph G would only be considered adjacent if two regions share border (not just a point).
  
  Defining it in the scope of graph thoery, given any map, where the states/regions represent vertices, there exists a mapping to a planar graph where no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. Such plane graph can be acheived with at most 4 colors and is therefore 4 colorable. 
  
  The mapping can be easily done by replacing every region by a vertex and connecting two vertices by an edge exactly when the two regions share a border.

Lemma 1
---
For any planar graph Gn with n ( n ≥ 6 ) vertices, there are vertices v_n , v_n−1  , …, v_6 such that d(v_i) ≤ 5 and G_i-1 = G_i - v_i are also planar graphs for i from n down to 6 . 

# Theorem (Four Color Thm): Every planar graph is four colorable. 
Proof: Let the planar graph with n vertices, n is at least 1, and denoted by Gn . There are 3 cases to discuss.
	Case 1:  When 1 <= n <= 4, the result holds (it’s obvious, G1 – G4)
	Case 2:  When n = 5, the maximal planar graph with 5 vertices is the full graph deleting an edge, i.e., the planar graph with 5 vertices and 9 edges, 
	Case 3:  If Lemma 1, occurs then It will be shown that c(Gi) = c(Gi−1 + vi) = 4 for i from 6 up to n in the following. For i from 6 up to n , since c(G5 ) = 4 by Case.2,
let c(G_i−1) = 4, and C(v) = {c(u)_i | c(u) is the color of vertex u in G_i−1 , and u is adjacent to i v in G_i }
Note that C(v_i) ≤ 4 and C(v_i) ≤ d(v_i) ≤ 5 . There are 3 cases (Case.3.1 - Case.3.3) to discuss.
