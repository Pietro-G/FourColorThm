In 1852 Francis Guthrie observed that the countries of England could be colored with four colors so that neighboring countries were colored differently. Francis Guthrie  (from the  book p. 260)

# Theorem (Four Color Thm): Every planar graph is four colorable. 
Proof: Let the planar graph with n vertices, n is at least 1, and denoted by Gn . There are 3 cases to discuss.
	Case 1:  When 1 <= n <= 4, the result holds (it’s obvious, G1 – G4)
	Case 2:  When n = 5, the maximal planar graph with 5 vertices is the full graph deleting an edge, i.e., the planar graph with 5 vertices and 9 edges, 
	Case 3:  There are a lot of Cases here
